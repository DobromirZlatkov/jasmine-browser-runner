## Breaking changes

* jasmine-core is now a peer dependency.

  This allows you to more easily control the installed version of jasmine-core.
  If you're upgrading from a previous version of jasmine-browser-runner, you
  may need to run `npm install --save-dev jasmine-core` after upgrading to
  0.9.0.

* Multiple changes to reporter configuration
  * A new `useConsoleReporter` config option, defaulting to true, controls
    whether the default console reporter is installed.
  * Specifying the `reporters` option doesn't prevent the console reporter
    from being installed.
  * The --clear-reporters CLI arg and `clearReporters` config option are
    replaced by a new `useHtmlReporter` config option, which defaults to
    true.

* The console reporter is exported as ConsoleReporter rather than DefaultReporter.

## New features and bugfixes

* Added commonly used env options to default config
* Console reporter output is colorized by default

## Documentation updates

* Clarified which jsdoc interface corresponds to the configuration
